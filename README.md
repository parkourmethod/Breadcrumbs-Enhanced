# Breadcrumbs-Enhanced

sample app discussed at www.parkourmethod.com and docs.parkourmethod.com

This is an upgraded version of Apple's breadcrumb sample project. We've modified the original sample project by integrating the parkour method location framework, and added features making it easier to demonstrate the operating modes of the parkour location framework.

If you have any questions please contact us at: team@parkourmethod.com

PS Many thanks to Apple Inc. for the initial Breadcrumb project! Lots of developers have used it to build their first location-driven apps and we hope this new version is equally helpful to the dev community.
